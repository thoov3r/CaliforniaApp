	<h1>My favorite subject is Computer Science</h1>


	<p> Coding is a way to more fully understand the backbone of what is happening in all technical devices around us.  I was introduced to coding my junior year in my AP Computer Science class.  This led to me take post-AP Data Structures and Algorithms this year in which I will be coding an app as a second semester final project.</p>
	<br>


	<p>Because of this, my favorite Academic Subject is Computer Science.  By taking this class, my eyes have been opened to the wide array of things that can be completed through code.  It allows you to develop new and innovative ideas that can be implemented in the everyday world.  I am excited to continue this passion in college.</p>
	<br>


	<p>Computer Science influenced me because when I code, I feel happy.  It has led me to pursuing a career that will somehow involve technology.  I strive to find a way to combine code and agriculture in an new way to enhance efficiency for farming.  This will lead to increased agricultural production in areas where agricultural development is a challenge, such as third world countries.  The thought of this excites me.  This is my passion.</p>
